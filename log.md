# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: worked on mocking the many to many relationship among the models in django

**Thoughts:** it was easy to understand how to implement it easily but my bad that i had issues with views, i should have had a warmup before jumping in

**Link to work:** private_repo :(
